## 	Importance of Python Programming

Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language. Python was designed to be highly readable which uses English keywords frequently whereas other languages use punctuation and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

It is used in :

Software Development

Web Development

System Scripting

Mathematics

### Python is Interpreted
It means that each line is processed one by one at runtime by the interpreter and you do not need to compile your program before executing it.

### Python is Interactive
It means that you can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly, to write and execute your programs.

### Python is Object-Oriented
Python supports the Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

### Python is Beginner's Language
Python is an excellent language for beginning programmers and facilitates the construction of a wide range of programs ranging from simple text processing to web browsers to games. Python does not have pointers, which is one of the main challenges that many of us have encountered when programming.

### Easy-to-maintain
Python's success is that its source code is fairly easy-to-maintain. One reason for that is, it is read and written like a lot of everyday English.

### A sample code of python

### A Broad Standard Library
One of Python's greatest strengths is the bulk of the library, which makes it very portable and cross-platform compatible. Python has libraries for almost everything one can think of.

### Interactive Mode
Support for an interactive mode in which you can enter results from a terminal right to the language, allowing interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.

### Portable
Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms. You can run the same python program on Windows, Linux, Mac, Raspberry Pi, Mango Pi, Android, etc.

### Extendable
You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient. Generally, we do that using the PIP command.

### Databases
Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases. It has packages to communicate with SQL, NoSQL, etc. databases, ranging from MongoDB to MySQL.

### GUI Programming
Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries, and windows systems, such as Windows, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix. It has libraries like Tkinter, WxPython, etc.

### Scalable
Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.

Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few of them are-

Support for functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
Very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
Supports automatic garbage collection.
It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.
